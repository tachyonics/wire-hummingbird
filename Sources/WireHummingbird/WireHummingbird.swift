// WireHummingbird — app-scoped collation for Hummingbird. Controllers
// (`@HummingbirdController`) and services (`@HummingbirdService`) contribute into collation
// keys; Wire emits a `HummingbirdComposable` conformance on the generated graph
// (knowing nothing about HTTP); `apply` applies the collated routes to a user-owned
// router that stays *outside* the graph and returns the collated services.
//
// The route surface carries no `Context` — a contributor's witness is a generic method,
// so the app's request context binds at the `apply` call, not on the controller.
// Controllers that need typed request-scoped state (auth) belong in WireMVC, not here.
//
// Each collation feature lives in its own file (`HummingbirdRoute.swift`,
// `HummingbirdService.swift`), extending `HummingbirdKeys` with its key; this file
// holds the shared surface — the keys namespace, the composable protocol, the graph
// conformance, and the `apply` facade.

/// The collation keys namespace; each feature adds its key by extension. `public`, so
/// the no-consumer check stays silent — the graph conformance consumes each invisibly
/// to the plugin, and an app could consume them externally — no `allowUnused` needed.
